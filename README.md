AAMU1 the Bionic Bulldogs 2025 robot code

There are two sets of code listed. The 24-inch robot code and the 15-inch robot code. 

24-inch:
This robot was originally planned to have an intake and scoring system as well as a goal clamp system. It was also intended to be built with the strength to lift our 15-inch robot. On top of this, there was meant to be an autonomous. So, in the code there's a lot of commented out code that I feel would be useful to keep for the sake of future coding teams. This way, instead of scowering the internet, there is working code listed in this repository. 
The remodeling of the 24-inch robot includes two functions. A 4-motor drivetrain and a 6-motor lift. We realized recently that due to the compact way our 15-inch robot was built, and the admittedly lightweight way our 24-inch was designed, it turned out that the 15-inch could lift our 24-inch and from there our robots can buddy climb. The redesign took out all of the internals on the 24-inch so now it can only drive and climb.

15-inch:
The 15-inch robot was meant to climb and play defense. Throughout our first competition, we found that attaching a claw to the edge of our climber and using that for scoring worked well when the drivers had some practice with the mechanism. The motors needed a locking mechanism in order to climb. It could easily reach the first rung but, due to the motors not being able to lock, the robot could not stay in it's compact climbing position when the systems shut down for judging at the end of each match. We attempted to lift our 15-inch robot with our 24-inch robot after making some mid match modifications, however, the robot was too heavy because of all its functions and its admittedly heavy design.
Through remodeling we found it best that the 15-inch lift the 24-inch but this was unfortunately after our competition. Still a joy to find out and witness despite that. However, we decided as of 2.21.2025 to remove any other functions from the 15-inch other than driving and lifting. As of this date, we are not attaching a claw or scoring mechanism. We may revisit that idea later given the proper amount of time. As of right now, both robots have the same functions: 4 motor drivetrains, and lift functions. The 24-inch lifts with 6 motors and the 15-inch lifts with 4 motors.
